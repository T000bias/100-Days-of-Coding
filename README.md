<h2>Day 1 / 100: To You, 100 Days from Now</h2>

<p> My <a href="https://twitter.com/Ui3er/status/1419849137500135425"> Tweet </a></p>

<p> Summary: Currently I am using a chrome extension called "100daysof.codes" (https://100daysof.codes/). This extension allows you to Set a main goal of your journey and then set specific goals for each day; you can also set subtasks for that day's goal. The first day is always the hardest, but once you get over that hump the rest seems easy. Out         of my 4 subtasks set I only finished about 3 of them. Fatigue set in and I didn't want to go any further. I noticed that setting a small amount of task is better than              setting a whole bunch for the sake of getting something done. </p>

<p>Summary: For the 100th time I restarted my progress in Freecodecamp just to have a fresh start. So far all I did was the HTML & HTML5 section in freecodecamp. A good note taking not app to use with coding is remnote (https://www.remnote.io/knowledge-base). You can create a code section that color codes and indents any code you put inside it.       This is my first time using it so we will see if it comes in handy further down the line. </p>

<h2> Day 5/100: I finally know what it feels like </h2>
<p> Summary: First, I was accepted to Resilent Coders Bootcamp for their co-hort of 2021. Even though I will be getting trained how to be a software engineer I will still be updating my 100 days of code. Today showed me that copying code might not always yield the same result. For the first project apart of the "10 Mega Websites" wasn't working for me even though I copied the code exact. The first error on my part was putting the script outside of the body but even with that things still were not working properly. On top of that I completed some of Freecodecamp's "Applied Visual Design." </p>

<p> Summary: I don't remember much of the work I completed, but it was more of the freecodecamp "Responsive Web Design" modules. I also watched this video on entrepreneurship on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/1351746/learn/lecture/7997460#overview"> Udemy </a>. If you are new to entrepreneurship this course is worth picking up.</p>

<p> Summary: Even though Freecodecamp was detailed in their explanation of the flexbox and grid, I know have to dive deeper into those subjects before I feel comfortable using these new techniques.</p>

<h2> Day 11/100 | Date 08/22/2021 | Rough Roads Ahead </h2> 
<p> My <a href="https://twitter.com/Ui3er/status/1429647527813472257"> Tweet </a> </p>
<p> Summary: Got my certificate for the Responsive Web Design. Even though I spent hours obtaining this, I still need to go back through my notes on the modules and update my projects. Other than that it feels good to see my work paying off.</p>
<p> ADVICE: Even if your projects look like a baby did, be proud of them because they are 10,000 steps you will take to mastery </p>
