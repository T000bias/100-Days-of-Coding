Day 1 / 100: To You, 100 Days from Now

Twitter Post: https://twitter.com/Ui3er/status/1419849137500135425

Summary: Currently I am using a chrome extension called "100daysof.codes" (https://100daysof.codes/). This extension allows you to Set a main goal of your journey and then set specific goals for each day; you can also set subtasks for that day's goal. The first day is always the hardest, but once you get over that hump the rest seems easy. Out of my 4 subtasks set I only finished about 3 of them. Fatigue set in and I didn't want to go any further. I noticed that setting a small amount of task is better than setting a whole bunch for the sake of getting something done.
