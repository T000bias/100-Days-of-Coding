<h1> The next change that needs to be implemented is a navbar that goes to the specific day out of the 100; this should be a drop down box. </h1>
<h1> for list, there should be icons next to the main websites and there should be links to the courses/books being completed </h1>

<h2 id="day1">Day 1 / 100: To You, 100 Days from Now</h2>

<p> My <a href="https://twitter.com/Ui3er/status/1419849137500135425"> Tweet </a></p>

<p> Summary: Currently I am using a chrome extension called "100daysof.codes" (https://100daysof.codes/). This extension allows you to Set a main goal of your journey and then set specific goals for each day; you can also set subtasks for that day's goal. The first day is always the hardest, but once you get over that hump the rest seems easy. Out         of my 4 subtasks set I only finished about 3 of them. Fatigue set in and I didn't want to go any further. I noticed that setting a small amount of task is better than              setting a whole bunch for the sake of getting something done. </p>

<p>Summary: For the 100th time I restarted my progress in Freecodecamp just to have a fresh start. So far all I did was the HTML & HTML5 section in freecodecamp. A good note taking not app to use with coding is remnote (https://www.remnote.io/knowledge-base). You can create a code section that color codes and indents any code you put inside it.       This is my first time using it so we will see if it comes in handy further down the line. </p>

<h2 id="day5"> Day 5/100: I finally know what it feels like </h2>
<p> Summary: First, I was accepted to Resilent Coders Bootcamp for their co-hort of 2021. Even though I will be getting trained how to be a software engineer I will still be updating my 100 days of code. Today showed me that copying code might not always yield the same result. For the first project apart of the "10 Mega Websites" wasn't working for me even though I copied the code exact. The first error on my part was putting the script outside of the body but even with that things still were not working properly. On top of that I completed some of Freecodecamp's "Applied Visual Design." </p>

<p> Summary: I don't remember much of the work I completed, but it was more of the freecodecamp "Responsive Web Design" modules. I also watched this video on entrepreneurship on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/1351746/learn/lecture/7997460#overview"> Udemy </a>. If you are new to entrepreneurship this course is worth picking up.</p>

<p> Summary: Even though Freecodecamp was detailed in their explanation of the flexbox and grid, I know have to dive deeper into those subjects before I feel comfortable using these new techniques.</p>

<p> Summary: Finished the product landing page for FCC (freecodecamp) and branched out to software engineers on LinkedIn and Twitter (of all places). Learned a few things that gave me the confidence to keep going with my journey.</p>

  <figcaption> Advice </figcaption>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't Give Up.</li>
    <li>Once you are building fullstack apps, you are job ready, whether you think you are or not.</li>
    <li>Try 100 devs</li>
    <li>When it gets hard, just remind yourself that it will all make sense eventually.</li>
    <li> Coding is 90% not giving up and 10% pushing yourself.</li>

<p> My <a href="https://twitter.com/Ui3er/status/1429647527813472257"> Tweet </a> </p>
<p> Summary: Got my certificate for the Responsive Web Design. Even though I spent hours obtaining this, I still need to go back through my notes on the modules and update my projects. Other than that it feels good to see my work paying off.</p>
<p> ADVICE: Even if your projects look like a baby did, be proud of them because they are 10,000 steps you will take to mastery </p>

<p>Summary: Did 10 modules of the "Basic JavaScript" for FCC. Planning on going thru the #100Devs discord and working on some projects they have done and getting feedback from that community on my work and what could use improving.</p>

<p> My <a href="https://twitter.com/Ui3er/status/1429990580805939201"> Tweet</a> </p>
<p> Another day of doing the freeCodeCamp (I see why they spell the name out like this, IYKYK) basic JavaScript modules and did some reading of simple JavaScript from "If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript". I finished the day off with a YouTube video on Front-End engineering just to get a lay of the land. Hopefully by my next log in I will have a navbar at the top of this repository that will allow navigation to all days. This not gives me practice on making navigation bars, but also confindence in my abilities. </p>
