Day 1 / 100: To You, 100 Days from Now

Twitter Post: https://twitter.com/Ui3er/status/1419849137500135425

Summary: Currently I am using a chrome extension called "100daysof.codes" (https://100daysof.codes/). This extension allows you to Set a main goal of your journey and then set              specific goals for each day; you can also set subtasks for that day's goal. The first day is always the hardest, but once you get over that hump the rest seems easy. Out          of my 4 subtasks set I only finished about 3 of them. Fatigue set in and I didn't want to go any further. I noticed that setting a small amount of task is better than              setting a whole bunch for the sake of getting something done.

Day 3 / 100 If its for free its for me!!!

Summary: For the 100th time I restarted my progress in Freecodecamp just to have a fresh start. So far all I did was the HTML & HTML5 section in freecodecamp. A good note taking            not app to use with coding is remnote (https://www.remnote.io/knowledge-base). You can create a code section that color codes and indents any code you put inside it. This          is my first time using it so we will see if it comes in handy further down the line.
